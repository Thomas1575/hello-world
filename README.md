# hello-world
My first repository, support is appreciated greatly â˜º.

Hi everyone, Thomas here,

I'm 14 years old, and a determined coder.
 I have taught myself the basics of python,
 and even gone on to more complex topics.
Any support will help me continue trying
to fulfil my dream. I would really like to
try and progress as quickly as possible
to get the best opportunities for when I
am older.
